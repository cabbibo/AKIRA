   NOTES

//SHADER NOTES:

  -If using THREE.js shaders, need to reassign the values assigned in the original shader

  - using SC.modelView, because we want to do all teh 'pos' stuff BEFORE we define

  - Flip flop is to change from one mat to another


// TODO NOTES:


  PRE ALPHA:

  - figure out physics simulation particles
  - Clean up code
  - Figure out make and make build!


  - loader conditions
  - loader.failure() to be called on errors
  - loader.addFailure();
  - loader.onFailure();   // To make sure there are no extra
  - loader.failureDOM to be called whenever a application doesn't work.

  /*

     SHADERS

  */

  // Update ShaderLib
    - grab jaume's tools
    - 
      - Grab some new shaders for shaderLib:
        - Cross hatch shader and some of jaume's tools
      
  // Data to JSON GPU SHADER
  
    - create 'transition shader'
      - check out Mr.Doob Sporel for original vs/ time update vert shader
      - 

  // FBO Utils 
      -research further



  // Create Meta Balls


  // Particle Simulations
  - create easy debug meshes
  - create physicShaders
  - create 'const' creator which will stringify a passed in Variable



  /*

     ORGANIZATION

  */

  - Reorganize home dir
    - Make sure that there is an easy ways to create scenes and objects in the proper directory


  - Move Wombs from app to lib!
    scenes should be part of an individual app, not the fullLibb
    - This will us to more easily combine larger file structures object together acuratly

  // Chapter 1: Loss
  // Entropy and disappation. 
  users can follow whatever path they want, and by the end get to 'earth'



  // WE OVER:

  Lead users along path by showing them orbs that they can follow if they wish to.
  - Create 'possible points' array of next 'guide orb', one orb per 'section'
  - Each 'section' test for closest 'guide orb',
  - some sort of sub-particle system spawns for each guide orb to give the users comfort,
    and reward them for following path. 


  - end of Path is Earth which leads to :


 
  // NEXT SONG




  - The path of lonliness ( aka not hitting any guides has its own reward if user makes it to the end ( 
        easter egg )
